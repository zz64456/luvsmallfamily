# 朝日計畫 The Asahi Project - Bringing the First Ray of Hope to Stray Animals

### Making every act of kindness visible, and every expenditure decided by you.

## Project Overview

The Asahi Project was born from a simple yet profound observation: despite a society full of compassion, donors are often left in the dark about how their contributions are used. This lack of trust prevents more people from participating.

Our goal is to use technology to build a **fully transparent and community-driven pet donation platform**. This is more than just a donation system; it's a Proof of Concept (POC) to demonstrate that we can shift **donation decision-making power from centralized organizations to every single donor**.

We believe that when kindness can be quantified and tracked, and decision-making power returns to supporters, the impact of every donation will be maximized, truly bringing a new dawn of hope to stray animals.

## Core Features

* **Donation Transparency**

* **Collective Decision-Making**

* **Story Sharing**

* **Sustainable Operations**

## Tech Stack

* **Backend**: **Python** with the **Django** framework for rapid development of a stable backend service; **MySQL** as a reliable relational database to ensure data integrity; **Django REST Framework** for building a clean API interface.

* **Frontend**: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to build a user interface with the most fundamental and flexible tech stack, ensuring the project is lightweight and scalable.

* **Containerization**: **Docker** and **Docker Compose** ensure a consistent development, testing, and deployment environment while simplifying complex service dependencies.

* **Version Control**: **Git** is used for collaborative development and effective tracking of all code changes.

## Future Plans

* **Short-term Goal**: We will focus on the **Proof of Concept (POC) phase** by successfully building a functional platform and attracting our first core users to validate the feasibility of our transparency and collective decision-making model.

* **Mid-term Goal**: Once the platform is stable, we will actively explore **advertising and sponsorship models** to ensure the project can be self-sustaining and achieve a monthly revenue target.

* **Long-term Vision**: We plan to research and **integrate blockchain technology** to further enhance the transparency and immutability of donations. Additionally, we will develop a **donation leaderboard and a badge system** to gamify the experience and encourage long-term participation.
